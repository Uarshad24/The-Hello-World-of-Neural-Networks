# The-Hello-World-of-Neural-Networks

Welcome to the "Hello World of Neural Networks" repository! This collection contains several beginner-friendly projects that demonstrate the basics of neural networks and deep learning.

### Projects
#### 1. House Pricing
This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features, such as area, number of bedrooms, and other factors. It covers basic regression using neural networks.

Key Concepts:

  * Regression
  * Feature Scaling
  * Model Training and Evaluation

#### 2. Image Classification with TensorFlow (MNIST & Fashion MNIST)
This project explores image classification using two popular datasets: MNIST and Fashion MNIST. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) for training, with 10,000 images for testing. Fashion MNIST consists of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items (e.g., T-shirts, pants, shoes) for training, and 10,000 test images. \
The objective is to build models to classify these images. For MNIST, a Dense Neural Network is used, while for Fashion MNIST, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is applied to achieve better performance on image data. The project covers essential concepts like image preprocessing, model building, and training with TensorFlow. EarlyStopping is used to prevent overfitting during training.

Key Concepts

  * TensorFlow Built-in Datasets
  * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  * Image Normalization
  * Early Stopping Callbacks
  * Model Training and Evaluation

#### 3. Image Classification using Real-World Images (CATS VS DOGS)
This project explores image classification using the Kaggle Cats vs Dogs dataset. Originally containing 25,000 images, the dataset has been filtered down to 2,002 images for this project. The goal is to build a model that can classify images as either containing a cat or a dog.

Key Concepts

  * Image Preprocessing with TensorFlow Data API
  * Data Augmentation
  * Transfer Learning (InceptionV3)
  * Model Training and Evaluation
  * Model Prediction
